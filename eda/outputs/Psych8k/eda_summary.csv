Before I can provide any feedback or guidance, can you please tell me more about your experience? For example, how long have these feelings of disconnection been happening, and are there any other symptoms you've noticed recently? It would also be helpful to know about any stressors in your life right now or any history of mental health issues in your family. This information will help me understand your situation better."": 1, ""It sounds like you've felt trapped and misunderstood in your family, and unsure of your own self-worth. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and find healthy ways to discuss them. Have you tried expressing your thoughts to your mom or anyone else close to you in a calm manner? It might help open up a dialogue and improve your relationship."": 1, ""I can see that you're trying to take charge of your emotions and self-worth. It's okay to be hesitant at first; change takes time. Try visualizing your newfound self-worth in a safe place within you. Keep repeating your positive affirmation, and remember that you are indeed worthy of love."": 1, ""It's great that you're feeling more comfortable expressing yourself. It seems like you still struggle with the words disappearing quickly, and that is something we can work on. As for your desire to live an unstructured life and not needing her, it's important to acknowledge that the constricting feelings are coming from within you. Try to focus on finding the balance between structure and freedom in your life. Is there a specific situation where you feel constricted and would like to change that?"": 1, ""I understand that you're experiencing a high level of worry and anxiety, which may be limiting your ability to enjoy and cherish life fully. It seems like there might be a part of you that is always watchful and concerned about the tasks you have to do. Let's start with addressing this worry and finding strategies to help you manage it effectively, so you can focus more on enjoying your life. Can you provide a specific example of a situation that caused you significant anxiety?"": 1, ""It's understandable that you want to prioritize connection and family while also managing other aspects of your life.

Can you identify the most important aspects of your life that you'd like to focus on during this period?"": 1, ""It seems like you're experiencing physical symptoms caused by underlying worry. These symptoms might be your body's response to the stress you're experiencing, like coping with daily tasks and managing relationships. Can you provide some insight into the specific situations or thoughts that trigger these feelings and physical symptoms for you?"": 1, ""It sounds like you experienced a significant change at a young age, and it's normal to feel scared and confused in such situations. As a young girl, it can be difficult to adapt to new environments. I would encourage you to share more about how this experience affected you and what coping mechanisms you used at the time. Were there any specific experiences or incidents that stand out to you as particularly challenging or memorable?"": 1, ""I can sense that you struggled with your emotions as a child and used humor as a coping mechanism. It's important now to recognize and process those feelings from the past. Can you identify any specific situations or emotions from that time that still cause you distress?"": 1, ""It sounds like the environment you grew up in didn't allow you to express yourself freely and left you feeling unloved and unseen unless you met specific expectations.

input,object,0,8187,"{""Lately, I've been feeling really disconnected from reality. I often find it hard to distinguish between what's real and what's not. For example, last week, I was having dinner with my family, and I suddenly thought my brother was about to attack me. I know it doesn't make any sense, but it felt real in that moment. This has happened a few times, but not all the time. I'm also having a hard time concentrating and remembering things that have happened recently. I've had some depressive episodes in the past, but this seems a bit different to me. Can you help me figure out what's going on?"": 1, ""I don't feel that there is anyone I can talk to. I remember once my sister and I decided to run away. I told my mom that we're running away because I feel trapped in this house and I don't feel I can do anything right. I don't really think I did anything particularly that wrong compared to my other friends who are complete wrecks."": 1, ""I feel like I want to get that jumper, wrap up, and then I'll say that now that's you now. Not me. I'm hesitant, but I want to keep repeating to myself that I am worthy of love."": 1, ""I feel a bit more relaxed saying it, but the words still go away quickly. I feel a bit more determined and bullish with it now. I want to be free to express myself and my feelings, and live a more unstructured life. I don't really need her at all."": 1, ""I feel like life has a lot of demands and I'm always worried about handling them. Even though I want to participate in life and cherish it, I've been missing out because of my constant anxiety. I'm constantly checking if things are okay and if I'm doing everything right."": 1, ""I'm worried about how much energy I can give to everything going on in my life, especially because I want to focus on connection and family. I want to take this opportunity to embrace this beautiful gift with both hands, while also keeping all the other things going and juggling everything."": 1, ""This morning, while I was working, my whole left side of my body locked up, especially my neck. I don't think it's because I slept badly or was cold. It's like my neck doesn't believe my head can take so much pressure, and it's worried that my head might fall. I also experience headaches and anxiety."": 1, 'When I was eight years old, I felt scared and confused after my family moved into a new place. I struggled to fit in and often felt lonely.': 1, 'When I was eight, I was a wreck most of the time, but I used to hide it behind a comedy role, trying to entertain everyone like a clown.': 1, ""I grew up in a controlling environment where I was only noticed and loved if I followed the rules and behaved a certain way. It's like you only get rewarded when you do what they say and there's no space for anything else."": 1}"
