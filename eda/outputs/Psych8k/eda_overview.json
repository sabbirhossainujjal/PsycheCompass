Before I can provide any feedback or guidance, can you please tell me more about your experience? For example, how long have these feelings of disconnection been happening, and are there any other symptoms you've noticed recently? It would also be helpful to know about any stressors in your life right now or any history of mental health issues in your family. This information will help me understand your situation better.",

For example, last week, I was having dinner with my family, and I suddenly thought my brother was about to attack me. I know it doesn't make any sense, but it felt real in that moment. This has happened a few times, but not all the time. I'm also having a hard time concentrating and remembering things that have happened recently. I've had some depressive episodes in the past, but this seems a bit different to me. Can you help me figure out what's going on?",

Additionally, it would be helpful to know about any changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, or any other physical or emotional symptoms you're experiencing.

I have noticed that my mood has been low for weeks now, but I haven't had any hallucinations or delusions. One day, I was walking in a crowded place and suddenly, I felt completely detached from everyone around me; it was like seeing the world through a thick fog. My family says that I am being distant and they worry about me, and I'm starting to worry about myself too.",

It's good to hear that you can still function normally, but it's crucial to figure out what might be causing these feelings of being 'off.'

I have been feeling a bit disconnected from my friends, but we still hang out and talk normally. My sleeping habits haven't changed much, but I occasionally have some vivid dreams. For the past two months, there were two unusual events where I saw flashes of light that weren't there. I don't think I've experienced any hallucinations, though. My performance at work hasn't been affected, and I can still function normally.",
